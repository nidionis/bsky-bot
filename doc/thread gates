Thread gates set who can reply to a post.

The available rules are:

app.bsky.feed.threadgate#mentionRule: Allow replies from actors mentioned in your post.
app.bsky.feed.threadgate#followingRule: Allow replies from actors you follow.
app.bsky.feed.threadgate#followerRule: Allow replies from actors following you.
app.bsky.feed.threadgate#listRule: Allow replies from actors on a list.
A thread gate may have up to 5 rules.

Setting a thread gate
Typescript
Python
You set a thread gate by creating a app.bsky.feed.threadgate record with the same rkey as the post you're gating.

from atproto import AtUri

rkey = AtUri.from_str(post_uri).rkey

record = models.AppBskyFeedThreadgate.Record(
    post=post_uri,
    allow=[
        # allow mentioned users
        models.AppBskyFeedThreadgate.MentionRule(),
        # allow followed users
        models.AppBskyFeedThreadgate.FollowingRule(),
        # allow list members
        models.AppBskyFeedThreadgate.ListRule(list=listUri),
    ],
    created_at=client.get_current_time_iso(),
)
client.app.bsky.feed.threadgate.create(client.me.did, record, rkey)

If a thread gate record is present but empty, then nobody can reply.

record = models.AppBskyFeedThreadgate.Record(
    post=post_uri,
    allow=[],  # empty allow-list, nobody can reply
    created_at=client.get_current_time_iso(),
)
client.app.bsky.feed.threadgate.create(client.me.did, record, rkey)

If a thread gate record is not present, then anybody can reply.
