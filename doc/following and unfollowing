Following
Typescript
Python
Following a user is as easy as calling client.follow with the DID of the user you want to follow.

client.follow
  uri = client.follow(did).uri

Parameter	Type	Description	Required
did	string	The DID of the user to follow	Yes
Unfollowing
Unfollowing a user involves deleting the follow record via its URI, returned from agent.follow. This is very similar to what we did when unliking a post.

client.delete_follow
  client.delete_follow(uri)

Parameter	Type	Description	Required
uri	string	The URI of the follow record to delete	Yes
