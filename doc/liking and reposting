Liking and reposting
Liking and reposting posts are a core feature of Bluesky. The official atproto SDK has dedicated methods for these actions.

Liking a post
Liking a post requires the post's URI and its CID.

The URI indicates the repository DID, collection, and record key. The CID is the hash of the record itself.

Typescript
Python
client.like
  uri = client.like(uri=uri, cid=cid).uri

Parameter	Type	Description	Required
uri	string	The URI of the post	Yes
cid	string	The CID of the post	Yes
Unliking a post
Unliking a post requires only the post's URI, which refers to its record. In the case of a Like, unliking the post means deleting the Like record.

Typescript
Python
client.delete_like
  client.delete_like(uri)

Parameter	Type	Description	Required
uri	string	The URI of the post to un-like	Yes
Reposting a post
Reposting and un-reposting looks almost exactly the same as liking and unliking.

Typescript
Python
client.repost
  uri = client.repost(uri=uri, cid=cid).uri

Parameter	Type	Description	Required
uri	string	The URI of the post	Yes
cid	string	The CID of the post	Yes
Un-reposting a post
Same as unlike, un-reposting a post requires only the post's URI, whose record we want to delete.

Typescript
Python
client.delete_repost
  client.delete_repost(uri)

Parameter	Type	Description	Required
uri	string	The URI of the post to un-repost	Yes
